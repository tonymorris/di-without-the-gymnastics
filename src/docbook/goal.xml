    The real goal is:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          to introduce you to some interesting and useful data structures
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          to introduce you to a not-so-beginner view of a programming technique (I like living on the edge &mdash; do you?) called <emphasis>pure functional programming</emphasis>
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          to achieve these two goals by appealing to a problem you are likely already familiar with (DI)
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          it's going to look a bit like we are picking on DI, though this is not a goal (it does a spectacular job of that on its own)
